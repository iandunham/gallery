This a fork of the [rCharts gallery](https://github.com/ramnathv/rChartsGallery) by Ramnath Vaidyanathan, which in turn
uses the same codebase as the [d3js gallery](http://biovisualize.github.com/d3visualization), developed by Christophe
Viau [@@d3visualization](https://twitter.com/d3visualization), with the help of the community and support
from [Datameer](http://www.datameer.com). and [@mrejfox](https://twitter.com/mrejfox). I would like to thank Christophe
Viau and Ramnath Vaidyanathan for providing code on Github.</p>

Here is the original README text:
