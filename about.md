# Gallery

This is a gallery of [Forge](https://github.com/iandunham/Forge) analyses of sets of SNPs for inidivdual
phenotypes in the [GWAS catalog](http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies) downloaded on 7th August 2013. Click on a
thumbnail to see the full interactive chart of a FORGE analysis of GWAS SNPs for an individual phenotype.
You can filter the gallery by Author (all me at the moment), Phenotype, Data (ENCODE or Epigenome) and Catagory (groupings of phenotypes)
using the filters at the right.  The filter box will also restrict by any text you enter. You can also
share the url to a filtered result gallery.

For more information on the FORGE analysis see the [documentation page](http://www.1000genomes.org/node/959) and
the [Forge github pages](https://github.com/iandunham/gallery/).

This gallery uses a csv file to store data : [forge_gallery.csv](https://github.com/iandunham/gallery/blob/gh-pages/forge_gallery.csv)
in the github repository.

# Credits

This gallery uses code forked from the [rCharts gallery](https://github.com/ramnathv/rChartsGallery) by Ramnath Vaidyanathan, which in turn uses the same codebase as the [d3js gallery](http://biovisualize.github.com/d3visualization), developed by Christophe Viau [@@d3visualization](https://twitter.com/d3visualization), with the help of the community and support from [Datameer](http://www.datameer.com). and [@mrejfox](https://twitter.com/mrejfox). I would like to thank Christophe Viau and Ramnath Vaidyanathan for providing code on Github.
